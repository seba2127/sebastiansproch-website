<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p2> I currently live in Cary, Illinois with my family. I have two younger sisters, but I don't have any brothers. I currently live with my my and my 
step-dad, but I plan on moving closer to school next year. My dad currently lives in Oak Lawn. I am currently majoring in Computer Science. 
I am excited, but scared at the same time. I have heard a lot of mixed information about computer science and how difficult it may be.

</ul>

<h3> My Favorite Hobby <h3>

<p3> My favorite hobby currently is going to the gym. I go to the gym every day of the week for about 2 hours. I love lifting, because it helps 
relax my mind and ease my stress. My gym workout routine is a push, pull, and leg routine that I do twice a week. I basically have two push
days, two pull days and two leg days in one week. The last day of the week is a cardio based day.
